My (tscoffe) questions about the RefCountPtr.

Q When does a RefCountPtr act like a pointer and when like an object?
Q What does const RefCountPtr really mean?
Q What does RefCountPtr<const foo> really mean?
Q When should I use a RefCountPtr vs. a reference?
Q Can I use a typedef with RefCountPtr to avoid the verbose notation?
Q What's up with this &* notation?
Q What are some anecdotal examples of why you don't want to use raw pointers?
Q What are some simple examples of why you don't want to use raw pointers?
A
	class Bar 
	{
	  public:
	    Bar() {};
	    ~Bar() {};
	};
	class Foo
	{
	  public:
	    Foo() { Bar *Bptr_ = new Bar; };
	    ~Foo() { delete Bptr_; };
	    void setPtr(Bar *Bptr) { Bptr_ = Bptr; };
	    Bar *getPtr() { return(Bptr_); };
	  protected:
	    Bar *Bptr_;
	};
	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
	  Bar *Bptr = new Bar;
	  Foo F;
	  F.setPtr(Bptr);
	  delete Bptr;
	  return(0);
	}
Q  What are some anecdotal examples of why you don't want to use references everywhere?
Q  What are some simple examples of why you don't want to use references everywhere?
Q  What is the overhead in terms of syntax that is necessary to start using RefCountPtr?
