* Convert basicExample to R^n
* Write Unit tests
* Ross:  Create container class for passing vectors between steppers
* Ross:  Rework ModelEvaluator to use vectorContainer class and then have derived classes for Epetra which do all the Thyra/Epetra conversion for the user automagically.
* Ross:  Remove Stepper::TakeStep(void) and change Stepper::TakeStep( Scalar dt = LET_STEPPER_CHOSE_STEP ).  This will make it easier for subclasses to implement this interface.
* Ross:  ModelEvaluator needs to expose vector spaces for various uses and initial guesses?
* Ross:  ModelEvaluator should have a momento state (for stateful).
* Add features to Stepper:  momento, restart, LTE, get_solution(dt), etc.
* Add interpolation buffer class
